<p><b>The World Wide Web</b><br>
Invented in the early 1990's, the world wide web is a collection of HTML documents. 
<em> HTML</em> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
It is the basis for almost every webpage. 
The links between pages are <em>hyperlinks</em>
or links for short. They make the web "web-like".

Your browser makes requests via the internet to servers, computers that host the files that make up the web.
These requests are using a protocol called http, the main protocol of the web. 
The servers respond with files that your browser displays. <br>
<em>Examples of browsers: Internet Explorer, Chrome, FireFox</em>
<br></BR><b>HTML is made up of</b><br>
  -text content: what you see<br>
  -mark up: what it looks like (how it's arranged)<br>
  -reference to other documents: images and videos<br>
  -links to other pages <br><br> 
  <b>HTML markup</b><br>
  Markup is made up of "tags", it includes (1) a less than symbol, (2) the tag name, 
  (3) the greater than symbol, (4) the contents, which can be other tags or just simply text, 
  and (5) another less than symbol with a slash and tag name, ending with a greater than symbol.
  <br> 
  Names are always the same, the only difference is the closing tag has a slash in front of the name. 
  <br> The whole thing can also be referred to as an <em> element</em>. 
  <br> <br>
  <b> Tags</b>
  <br>Different tags can influence the effect of the text, for example, 
  the b-tag,(< b >) makes anything between the opening tag and closing tag appear <b>bold </b>. The < em > tag 
  makes text <em> italized</em>. If you forget to close the tag, everything after the opening tag will follow 
  the instructions given by the first tag. That is why we sometimes refer to computers as being "stupid", due 
  to their literal interpretations of all our commands. 
  <br>The image tag < img >, allows you to include images. **Images do not have a closing tag because there are no 
contents to an image. It is known as a <em> void tag.</em>
<br><br> 
<b>HTML attributes</b><br>
You can render things in html that link urls to certain words in a text. <a href="https://youtu.be/-0S9lBFHeo0">Such as this.</a> 
The video linked to that explains how to use the < a >, anchor tag, very efficiently. 
<br><br> 
<b> Inline/Block</b><br>
There are two different ways of making a break. The < br > is inline, where the < p > is block. The block makes an invisible 
box around the text, and you can adjust the height and width.
